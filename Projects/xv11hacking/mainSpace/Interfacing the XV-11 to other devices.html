 There is an ROS driver that connects to the XV-11 through the USB port, documentation can be found on the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/neato_robot" rel="nofollow">ROS wiki</a>. This driver includes both an ROS-independent python implementation and an ROS node wrapper for the python implementation. It currently controls the mobile base, provides odometry feedback, and publishes laser scans. Future versions will include battery and sensor access features (the currently exist in the ROS-independent code, but have not yet been given a proper ROS API).
