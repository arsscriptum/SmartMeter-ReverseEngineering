<p><h1>LIDAR Sensor</h1></p>The LIDAR sensor is what started this entire project. Find all the information you need below.<br />
<br />
The actual name of the sensor is Piccolo Laser Distance Sensor, abbreviated into LDS, but many different names are used to refer to it: Neato LDS, Neato lidar, XV-11 lidar, XV-11 sensor...<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc0"><a name="x-Hardware versions"></a>Hardware versions</h2>
 At least two major hardware versions of the LDS have been seen in the wild. E<span style="line-height: 1.5;">xternally, they look identical, but they differ electrically.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">One way to know for sure which one you have is to open the top of the sensor (by removing the 4 screws maintaining the cap, but don't touch the 6 screws under the unit!) and to have a look at what is written at the pad where the red wire coming from the center is soldered.</span><br />
<br />
In all versions, <span style="line-height: 1.5;">LDS_TX and LDS_RX are a <strong>8N1</strong> serial port at <strong>3.3V</strong>. The baud rate is <strong>115200</strong>.</span><br />
<br />
The connector of the LDS is a <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">JST PH 2.0mm pitch</a> <span style="line-height: 1.5;">with 4 pins (Reference: PHR-4).</span><br />

<h2 id="toc1"><a name="x-Motor"></a>Motor</h2>
 The motor has to be driven by the host. In the robot, it's that main board that drives it using PWM from the battery voltage of 12V, as it also controls the speed in closed loop.<br />
The motor can be powered at 3.3V continuous <span style="line-height: 1.5;">( ~60mA ) in open loop, which will produce a turn rate of around 240rpm on a clean and recent sensor. Hair and dust can however create friction that will lower the rotation speed.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Using the turn rate information contained in the data, a closed loop control can be implemented, and is recommended.</span><br />

<h2 id="toc2"><a name="x-Firmware versions"></a>Firmware versions</h2>
 Firmware version can be retrieved by listening to what the sensor says immediately after power-up, or through the robot's API.<br />
<br />
<ul><li><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">v2.1</span></strong></li></ul><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Only used in the early 3.3V versions of the hardware (and probably only in these).</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Data format is different from the one of following versions.</span><br />
<br />
<ul><li><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">v2.4</span></strong></li></ul>Used in the 5V and potentially in updated 3V3 versions too (needs confirmation).<br />
Data format is not compatible with v2.1.<br />
<br />
<ul><li><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">v2.6</span></strong></li></ul>Used in the 5V<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> and potentially in updated 3V3 versions too (needs confirmation).</span><br />
Data format is the same as the one of v2.4.<br />
The menu items and secret menus have changed, and among other things, a little game has been added with the names of the people who did the reverse engineering as the bosses :D<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc3"><a name="x-Gotchas"></a>Gotchas</h2>
 <ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The angle of the data is not aligned with the natural axis of the device. It seems that the first sample of the first packet is in fact looking at a -10° angle, not 0°. Needs confirmation.</span></li><li>v2.4 and above: <span style="line-height: 1.5;">The sensor needs to be turning between 180 and 349 rpm to transmit valid data. Above 349 rpm, the serial interface becomes the bottleneck and packets will be missing, and blow the lower limit the firmware simply does not send anything. It also seems that above 320 rpm, data becomes sparse (only one out of two has an actual value).</span></li></ul><br />

A full revolution will yield 90 packets, containing 4 consecutive readings each.<br />
The length of a packet is 22 bytes.<br />
This amounts to a total of 360 readings (1 per degree) on 1980 bytes.<br />
<br />
Each packet is organized as follows:<br />

It represents the speed, in 64th of RPM (aka value in RPM represented in fixed point, with 6 bits used for the decimal part).</li><li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace; line-height: 1.5;">[Data 0]</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> to [</span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace; line-height: 1.5;">Data 3]</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> are the 4 readings. Each one is 4 bytes long, and organized as follows :</span></li></ul><br />
`byte 0 : &lt;distance 7:0&gt;`<br />
`byte 1 : &lt;&quot;invalid data&quot; flag&gt; &lt;&quot;strength warning&quot; flag&gt; &lt;distance 13:8&gt;`<br />
`byte 2 : &lt;signal strength 7:0&gt;`<br />
`byte 3 : &lt;signal strength 15:8&gt;`<br />
<br />
As <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://sites.google.com/site/chenglung/home/xv-11-open-lidar-project-matlab-script" rel="nofollow">chenglung</a> points out, the distance information is in mm, and coded on 14 bits. This puts the tests made by Sparkfun in a room of around 3.3m x 3.9m (11ft x 13 ft ?), which seems reasonable.<br />
The minimum distance is around 15cm, and the maximum distance is around 6m.<br />
<br />
When bit 7 of byte 1 is set, it indicates that the distance could not be calculated. When this bit is set, it seems that byte 0 contains an error code. Examples of error code are 0x02, 0x03, 0x21, 0x25, 0x35 or 0x50...<br />
When it's `21`, then the whole block is `21 80 XX XX`, but for all the other values it's the data block is `YY 80 00 00`...<br />
<br />
<br />
The bit 6 of byte 1 is a warning when the reported strength is greatly inferior to what is expected at this distance. This may happen when the material has a low reflectance (black material...), or when the dot does not have the expected size or shape (porous material, transparent fabric, grid, edge of an object...), or maybe when there are parasitic reflections (glass... ).<br />
<br />
Byte 2 and 3 are the LSB and MSB of the strength indication. This value can get very high when facing a retroreflector.<br />
<br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">checksum</span> is a two-byte checksum of the packet.</li></ul><br />
The algorithm is as follows, provided that `data` is the list of the 20 first bytes, in the same order they arrived in.<br />

 The periodicity of the data is 1446 bytes.<br />
<br />
It is organized as follow :<br />
<br />
`5A A5 00 C0 XX XX &lt;data&gt;`<br />
<br />
where `XX XX` is an information about the current rotation speed of the module, in clock ticks (little endian). <a class="wiki_link" href="FJ_Sanchez%20and%20shimniok.html">http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/showthread.php?t=4470&amp;page=5</a> posted interesting data about this.<br />
<br />
`&lt;data&gt;` is composed of 360 group of 4 bytes, organized like this :<br />
`byte 0 : &lt;distance 7:0&gt;`<br />
`byte 1 : &lt;&quot;invalid data&quot; flag&gt; &lt;&quot;quality warning&quot; flag&gt; &lt;distance 13:8&gt;`<br />
`byte 2 : &lt;quality 7:0&gt;`<br />
`byte 3 : &lt;quality 15:8&gt;`<br />
<br />
As <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://sites.google.com/site/chenglung/home/xv-11-open-lidar-project-matlab-script" rel="nofollow">chenglung</a> points out, the distance information is in mm, and coded on 13 or 14 bits. This would put the tests made by Sparkfun in a room of around 3.3m x 3.9m (11ft x 13 ft ?), which seems reasonable to me. 13 bits should be enough if the sensor is destined to work up to 6m. This needs some tests...<br />
<br />
The bit 7 of byte 1 seems to indicate that the distance could not be calculated.<br />
<br />
It's interesting to see that when this bit is set, the second byte is always `80`, and the values of the first byte seem to be only `02`, `03`, `21`, `25`, `35` or `50`...<br />
When it's `21`, then the whole block is `21 80 XX XX`, but for all the other values it's the data block is `YY 80 00 00`<br />
maybe it's a code to say what type of error ? (`35` is preponderant, `21` seems to be when the beam is interrupted by the supports of the cover) .<br />
Another thing to have a look to is the temporal repartition of the data... the first sample after the sync seems to always be `21 80 XX XX`, and when this pattern appears again, it's immediately after an other value, without the 0.2ms interval we can see most of the time between two blocks of 4...<br />
<br />
The bit 6 of byte 1 is a warning when the reported strength is greatly inferior to what is expected at this distance. This may happen when the material has a low reflectance (black material...), or when the dot does not have the expected size or shape (porous material, transparent fabric, grid, edge of an object...), or maybe when there are parasitic reflections (glass... ).<br />
<br />
<br />
Byte 2 and 3 are the LSB and MSB of the strength indication. This value can get very high when facing a retroreflector.<br />
