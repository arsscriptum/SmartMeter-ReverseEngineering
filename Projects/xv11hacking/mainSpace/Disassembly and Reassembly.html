<p><h1>Disassembly and Reassembly</h1></p>Pictorial instructions for disassembling and reassembling an XV-11 can be found at the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hbrobotics.org/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew Robotics Club</a> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hbrobotics.org/wiki" rel="nofollow">wiki</a> linked off of the page: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hbrobotics.org/wiki/index.php?title=Dave%27s_XV-11_notes" rel="nofollow">Dave's XV-11 Notes</a>. There are a few other XV-11 notes there as well, such as how to tap into the battery supply, and I'll be adding more as I go along. I'm too lazy to update two wiki's :) so I've decided to make the HBRC wiki my 'home' and cross-link from here to there and there to here.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the disassembly/reassembly instructions were done because I kept forgetting where all the screws go. Hope it helps.
