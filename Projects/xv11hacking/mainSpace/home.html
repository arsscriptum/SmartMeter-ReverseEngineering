This wiki will serve as a location to organize the thoughts and progress of anyone working on the XV-11 and its successors.<br />

 <br />
The Neato XV-11(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neato_Robotics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) is a robot which vacuum's your house. It is unlike any other however because it includes a <a class="wiki_link" href="LIDAR%20Sensor.html">low cost 360 degree laser distance scanner</a> (LIDAR See <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDAR" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>). This can be removed from the XV-11 and used in your own robotics projects or used within the XV-11 with the help of the Robot Operating System (ROS). The pages within this wiki document interfacing methods into the XV-11 and is open to anyone who wants to help.<br />
<br />
For $399 you can't find a better robotics platform in my opinion, definitely worth the cost even if you do nothing more than strip it down for parts. You will find it is very well constructed by some people who definitely know about robotics.<br />
