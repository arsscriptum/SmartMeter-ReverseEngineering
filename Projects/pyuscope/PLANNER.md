This is an internal API
Most users should not need to use it
This structure is called "config

Here is a very basic example:

```
{
    "imager": {
        "x_view": 1.0,
    },
    "contour": {
        "start": {
            "x": 0.0,
            "y": 0.0,
        },
        "end": {
            "x": 2.0,
            "y": 1.0,
        },
    },
}
```

List of parameters
  * imager
    * x_view: 
      * Default: none / required
    * scalar: an expected (but not applied) image scalar
      * Default: 1.0
      * Makes displayed pano information correct if you are post processing the image
      * Currently planner itself doesn't apply scaling but rather returns the raw image
  * contour: defines the scan area
    * start
      * Default: none / required
      * x: x minimum position imaged 
      * y: y minimum position imaged
    * end
      * Default: none / required
      * x: x maximum position imaged 
      * y: y maximum position imaged
  * tsettle: how long to wait between motion and image
    * Default: 0.0
  * step: ideal faction of image to move between images
    Default: 0.7 => only overlap adjacent image by 30%
  * border: automatically add this many mm to the edges of the contour (panorama)
  * end_at: where to return at the end of a job
    * zero: return to 0, 0
    * start: return to start coordinate (default)
  * motion
    * backlash: how much is requires to compensate for consistent motion
       * Can be a single number to apply to all or a dict of axes
    * backlash_compensate: whether all moves should be backlash compensated
       * Default: False
       * By default a serpintine is done but will have backlash
    * origin: where row 0, column 0 is on the image plane
      * Background: image coordinates tend to be upper left, but CNC machines lower left origin
      * Options:
        * ll: lower left
        * ul: upper left
      * Default: ll. This will make a standard CNC machine translate to image coordinates
  * exclude: inclusive row / column ranges to ignore
    * Default: []
    * Advanced / not well supported
    * Intended for resuming a scan to correct a bad area
    * items: {"r0": r0, "r1": r1, "c0": c0, "c1": c1}
